				<h1>Lab 11: Libraries & Intro to jQuery</h1>
				<p>For this lab, we experimented with jQuery.</p>
				<h1>Challanges </h1>
				<p> The challenge was that we had a time restriction and we couldn't
					 get into that much in using the css from jquery due to the submission. </p>
				<h1>Problems</h1>
				<p>Well the major problem is that we forgot about the lecture on how to use jquery but we did look up the lecture slides that you did and did a quick recap on it. </p>
				<h1>Results</h1>
					<p> Here are our results that are shown below.</p>
