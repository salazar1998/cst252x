	<h1>lab 1 - Getting Started</h1>
	<p>Summary of efforts: As we looked into many different websites to get the feel of the different types of UI systems, we analyzed the features that they had and concluded on three of them.
		  We discussed what features we liked and picked three ideal websites that caught our eye.
			Then we split the work in two and reviewed each of our writings about each website and organized the pages.
			The websites that we chose are different and out of the box which we liked. </p><br></br>

	<h2>Shadow and Bone</h2>

			<img src="img/shadowandbone2.png" width=400 style="border:4px solid black">
			<p> This site was made to represent the Netflix original series ”Shadow and bone”  that represents the series with cool graphics with a moving background which makes it look majestic. The features on the website that got us really interested was how every time you drag the cursor it moves on a different layout and makes it feel like you're entering a game sequence. What also caught our eyes was how this website made it interesting how they kept everything interactable. Our guess on how those features work is by a certain code that constantly runs with the movement of the cursor. The website is clean but does have a little lag that can be fixed with a little debugging.  </p><br></br>

			<h2>Juila Jonhson Profolio</h2>

					<p> Julia Johnson portfolio website shows the aspect of her designers projects that she has done. The UI system has expectational viewpoints that show her work that flows throughout the portfolio. What I liked about this website is the transitions of the work when you scroll down on the page. The way the artist presents the work is so dynamic that you want to continue scrolling down the website. There is a white background with the name of the artist that gives contrast to the artwork presented.   </p><br></br>

					<h2>Zoox</h2>

							<p> ZOOX website by Dogstudio & Zoox is a creative website that promotes a futuristic vehicle, throughout the website we can find the specifications of the car in a unique way. The website is full of animations, interactions and videos that play automatically when you scroll down. What I like about this website is the clean design and the white space used throughout the pages.  </p><br></br>
