				<h1>Lab 14: Loops</h1>
				<p>For this lab, we experimented with using loops to show consent repetition.</p>
				<h1>Challanges </h1>
				<p> The challenge was to figure out how to create a loop that showed fizzbuzzboom together in a single number.  </p>
				<h1>Problems</h1>
				<p>We had a difficult time figuring this one out because it wouldn't print on our local server.
					 We tried to use jquery but it wasn't working properly so we went back to the basics and did it with append child format</p>
				<h1>Results</h1>
					<p> Here are our results.</p>
