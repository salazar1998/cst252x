	<h1> Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
	<p>In this lab we get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding</p>
	<img src="img/mw.png" width=400>
		<h1>Challanges </h1>
			<p> It was a little difficult to code the Java script because we didn't have experience. </p>
			<h1>Results</h1>
				<p> We organized a list of high-level tasks for our computer program that is going to have to do to be complete.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="steps">
				<h2>Steps to start using your microwave<h2>
						<ul>
							<li>1. Read the user’s manual to know more about your microwave</li>
							<li>2. Through away user’s manual because you know you will never use it again</li>
							<li>3. The next step is to plug in your microwave</li>
							<li>4. Put the food in a microwave-safe utensil only </li>
							<li>5. Ensure that the utensil is microwave-safe otherwise it will explode your microwave</li>
							<li>6. Put food inside the microwave</li>
							<li>7. Close the microwave</li>
							<li>8. Set a right timer for the exact food you are reheating </li>
